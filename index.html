  <p>"Our mission as students is not to follow in the footsteps of astronauts, poet laureates and presidents who graduated before us but to exceed their footsteps, crush the shoulders of the giants on whom we stand"</p>
  <p>"We here are all such innovative people. So I am telling you: If you want to change the world, you're at Georgia Tech! You can do that! If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech! You can do that! If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a bad ass, we're at Georgia Tech, we can do that! I am doing that!"</p>
